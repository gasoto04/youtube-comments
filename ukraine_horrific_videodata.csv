The Sun,UCIzXayRP7-P0ANpq-nD-h5g,1645729732.0,Swarm of Russian helicopter gunships blitzing Ukraine airport as Putin launches invasion,"CHILLING video on Thursday appears to show the moment Russian helicopter gunships swept over Ukraine to attack an airport just miles from Kyiv.

Russian choppers can be seen hurtling over the landscape as they attacked the military base at Gostomel Airport.

Ukrainian officials said they managed to down at least three of the aircraft - but the Russians had managed to seize control of the area.

Kyiv's presidential office said there was ""fierce fighting"" at the airport.

In some of most dramatic footage of the invasion so far, the helicopters are seen flying low and appearing to be firing flares as they moved in.

Smoke is seen rising in the background from the devastated landscape amid the bloodshed which has plunged Europe into a new crisis.

The craft are believed to be a mix of Ka-52 Alligators, Mi-8s and Mi-24 military attack helicopters.

Elsewhere, fighter planes were seen flying low over Kyiv - while a Ukrainian An-26 transport plane was shot down, killing 5 people.

It came after Vladimir Putin declared WAR on Ukraine with an overnight barrage of artillery, airstrikes and missiles.

The tyrant declared a “special military operation” in Ukraine with a dawn raid after months of amassing his forces on the border and brazenly lying to the world about his plans to invade.

WarLeaks - Military Blog,UCuqdsYT5rFqw0L5oO_HwvgA,1645703724.0,🔴 Russia Declares War On Ukraine  - Russian Attacks & Invasion All Across The Country,"In this video we cover the first scenes of the Russian war in Ukraine as a series of Russian attacks initiating a full scale invasion of the whole country started to appear all over the internet.

President Putin stated that Russia has declared a war to demilitarize its neighbour Ukraine.

Reports from the area are massive and so a lot of new information unfolds each minute.

What we can say for sure is that Russia has started to attack several cities including the capital city of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Odessa and others in order to initiate a full air, sea and land borne invasion from Russian and Pro Russian held territory in Ukraine.

Targets till now were airports, facilities and Ukrainian military installations across the country.

For now mainly artillery, cruise missiles and MRLS variants were used to conduct the attacks but there are already reports of heavy gunfights between Ukrainian and Russian troops and of airstrikes on Ukrainian targets.

According to some sources Russian military helicopters and paratroopers were also already in anction.

We continue to report about this as new should unfold from now daily.

The attacks began on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that he had approved a “special military operation”. The move came after Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.
Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.
Russian troops attacked Ukraine from Belarus, as well as from Russia with Belarusian support. An attack was also being launched from the annexed Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine’s border guard service said.

Ukrainians woke up to find themselves plunged into the midst of war. Explosions and air raid sirens rang out here in Kyiv and cities across the country as Russia launched a full scale invasion on multiple fronts in the early hours of the morning, firing missiles at key military infrastructure sites.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

Its troops are reported to be advancing from the north of Kyiv. 
Other cities that have been targeted include Odessa, the major port on the Black Sea, and there are reports of hundreds of explosions in Mariupol, which is located close to Russian-occupied territory.

But also in towns like Lutsk in Ukraine's west. It shows the breadth of the assault from the Russian military.

Ukraine has declared martial law, urging citizens to take up arms to defend their country. There are reports of heavy casualties already on both sides. And as the West threatened to cripple Moscow's economy with devastating sanctions, an ominous warning from Vladimir Putin to any country trying to interfere - you will face ""consequences you have never seen"", he declared.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said weapons will be issued to those who want them and called on Ukrainians to donate blood. In an address to the nation, he said Russia had suffered losses during the initial stages of its invasion and added Ukraine had severed diplomatic relations with Russia.

DW News,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,1645712186.0,Western nations announce first reactions to Russia's invasion of Ukraine | DW News,"European Union leaders are to discuss new sanctions on Russia at an emergency meeting later on Thursday in reaction to its attack on Ukraine, the bloc has said. At a press conference, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for ""bringing war back to Europe"" in an ""unprecedented act of aggression … against a sovereign, independent country."" ""Russia's target is not only the Donbas; the target is not just Ukraine; the target is the stability of Europe and the whole of the international peace order,"" she said. She said new EU sanctions would be imposed on Russia's access to ""key technologies and markets."" The bloc would also freeze Russian assets in Europe and block Moscow's access to European financial markets,” she added. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the raft of sanctions to be discussed at the meeting were the ""strongest, the harshest package'' ever considered.

Russian tanks have entered Ukraine in the Luhansk region as well as from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, Ukraine's border guard service reports. The border guard also reported one casualty from shelling on the border with Crimea, the first confirmed military death during the invasion. Earlier Ukraine said eight people had died in the shelling. Police in Ukraine have said they are distributing weapons to vetrans. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air campaign against Ukraine was not targeting cities and did not pose a threat to civilians, according to the Russian state-run RIA news agency.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his intention to conduct a military operation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 Moscow Standard Time.


Captions: Circumstances require firm and immediate actions from us. Donbas's People's Republics asked for help from Russia. In this regard, according to the article 51 part 7 of the United Nations charter, with the consent of the Russian Federation Council and in accordance with the ratified agreement on 22 February of this year on friendship and mutual aid with Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, I decided to conduct a special military operation. Its goal is the protection of people who, during eight years, suffer from abuse and genocide from the Kyiv regime.

We urge you to lay down arms immediately and go home. I will explain: all servicemen of the Ukrainian army who comply with this requirement, can freely leave the area of military actions and return to their families.

Whoever would try to stop us and further create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any outcome.

I am confident that loyal soldiers and officers of Russia's Armed Forces fulfill their duty professionally and courageously.

The Sun,UCIzXayRP7-P0ANpq-nD-h5g,1645720171.0,Air raid sirens blare in Ukraine as Putin orders full-scale invasion,"Sirens blare In Kyiv and around Ukraine as Putin announces a military operation.

VLADIMIR Putin has declared WAR on Ukraine and unleashed his terrifying arsenal with a full scale assault on the country - plunging Europe into a bloody new crisis.

The tyrant declared a “special military operation” in Ukraine with a dawn raid after months of amassing his forces on the border and brazenly lying to the world about his plans to invade.

The world is waking up to what could the most horrific crisis since World War 2 as Putin seeks to tear down the world order.

His full scale invasion of Ukraine is all part of his deluded plan to rebuild the Soviet Union amid his paranoid fears over Nato.

Ukrainians faced the sound of booming explosions and blaring air raid sirens as missiles, airstrikes and artillery shells fell on their homeland.

Putin took to Russian airwaves at 5.50am Moscow time to order an aerial blitz in the first stage of his attack.

Moments later powerful explosions were reported and armoured columns were spotted moving towards the border.

Russia has some 200,000 soldiers ready to move in - encircling the north, south and east of Ukraine.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a speech announcing a military operation in Ukraine that countries that interfere with Russian actions will face “consequences you have never seen,” The Associated Press reported. 

Russia almost immediately launched an invasion into the country.

Putin says the operation is to protect citizens from Ukraine aggression and to demilitarize the country, a continuation of the disinformation about which western allies have been warning.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday that only Russia is to blame for an attack on Ukraine.""

The parliament in Poland, a nation on NATO’s eastern flank which borders Ukraine and Belarus, strongly denounced Russia’s attack on Ukraine and vowed its support to Ukraine.

Civilians piled into trains and cars to flee and border crossings increased from Ukraine to Poland, which has prepared centers for refugees.

One unammed couple with a child were crossing over to Poland and travelling to Cyprus after that.

""My husband told me that I am panicking and it won't happen and now it's true and this is absolutely incredible,"" said the wife as the couple crossed the border.

General Tomasz Praga, the Border Guard Commander in Chief,  said the situation at the Polish border with Ukraine remained stable despite an increase in crossings and said Border Guards were prepared for a surge in traffic.

The Russian president in a televised speech early Thursday said he has authorized a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine, according to AP and BBC News. Explosions have been reported in multiple cities in Ukraine following Putin’s announcement. Earlier, Putin secured approval to use armed forces abroad and a Kremlin spokesperson said that Russian-backed leaders in eastern Ukraine requested military assistance, AP reports. US President Joe Biden said in a statement, “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.”

A few hours ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced what he’s calling a ‘special military operation’ in the East of Ukraine. That’s where Russia recently recognised two regions of Ukraine as independent states. Not long after Putin's announcement people started reporting explosions around the country and Ukraine’s president Volodomyr Zelenskyy confirmed that Russian missile attacks have begun.
 
Putin says he does not plan to occupy Ukrainian territory and has described the Russian soldiers being sent in as peacekeepers. But things are changing rapidly and some countries are worried this will lead to an all out war. US President Joe Biden says the world will hold Russia accountable and Cities throughout Europe are showing their support for Ukraine.

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,UCaeUKy8bDzOu2DH5c006NbQ,1645777441.0,What Russia's invasion of Ukraine looks like,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine began with cameras in Manhattan and the Kremlin. There has never been a diplomatic scene like Russia's ambassador presiding over a Security Council meeting to prevent the very war his own president was busy declaring on television. Antonio Guterres called it the saddest moment in his tenure as UN Secretary General. Since then, the violence of Russian's attacks—from missile strikes on airports and residential areas outside Kyiv to Moscow police arresting journalists covering anti-war protests—has been made widely visible through individual cellphone recordings posted online. Although not all of the footage is easily attributed to any particular source, we are confident in the legitimacy of the scenes shared in this video. This is the first day of the war captured by cameras across Ukraine and as seen on screens worldwide.

Blue Global,UCuckjiphHdYM14u2b859meg,1645698058.0,"2022 - Ukraine - Russian Invasion: Aerial Bombing of Military Targets in Dnipro, Odessa & Mariupol","(MOSCOW, AFP/NYTIMES/REUTERS, 24 Feb 2022) - Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday (24 Feb 2022) in what could be the start of war in Europe over Russia’s demands for an end to NATO’s eastward expansion.

“I have made the decision of a military operation,” he said in a surprise statement on television shortly before 6am local time (11am Singapore time).

He went on to denounce what he called a “genocide” orchestrated by Ukraine in the country’s east, as well as NATOs aggressive policy towards Russia.

“For this, we will strive to achieve demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine,” said Mr Putin, promising to bring “to court those who have committed many crimes, responsible for the bloodshed of civilians, including Russian citizens”.

Mr Putin said that if there is any foreign interference, Russia will react immediately.

The responsibility for any bloodshed will be on the Ukrainian regime, he said.

Mr Putin said: "" Anyone who tries to interfere with us, or even more so, to create threats for our country and our people, must know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never before experienced in your history.""

“We are ready for any turn of events.”

Mr Putin cast his operation as an attack on “Nazis” in Ukraine, as well as rejection of the US-led world order.

Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato, he said, represented a dire threat to Russia.

He evoked the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 to make it clear that he viewed the West as morally bankrupt.

“For 30 years, we deliberately and patiently tried to reach agreement with the Nato countries on equal and indivisible security in Europe,” Mr Putin said.

But Russia was met, he said, with “cynical lies” and “blackmail” on the part of the West. “Where is the justice and truth?” Putin asked. “There is only pure lies and hypocrisy.”

The US-led West, he said, represented an “empire of lies"".

Hours before Mr Putin's announcement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow had approved an offensive and had not replied to an invitation for talks.

“Today, I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. The result was silence,” he said.

US President Joe Biden has, meanwhile, condemned the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"", adding that he will coordinate with Nato allies to ensure a strong, united response.

The world ""will hold Russia accountable"" over Ukraine, Mr Biden said.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Mr Biden said in a statement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.”

Soon after Mr Putin spoke, explosions rang out before dawn on Thursday in Ukraine's capital Kyiv and several cities near the frontline and along the country's coast.

AFP correspondents also heard blasts in the Black Sea port city of Odessa, with police and ambulance sirens heard across the Ukrainian capital city.

Explosions also rang out in Kharkiv, a large city 35km south of the Russian border.

Explosions also rocked the breakaway eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk and civilian aircraft were warned away as the US said a major attack by Russia on its neighbour was imminent.

Russia is targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure, air defence, and air forces with high-precision weapons and is not attacking Ukrainian cities, Russia’s RIA news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying on Thursday.

Kyiv has said Moscow has launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine, with military command centres in a number of cities hit by missiles.

In comments reported by Russian media, Mr Putin said he had authorised the special military operation in breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces were only a matter of time.

Hours after pro-Russian separatists issued a plea to Moscow for help to stop alleged Ukrainian aggression – claims the US dismissed as Russian propaganda – Mr Putin said he had ordered Russian forces to protect the people and demanded that Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.

He repeated his position that Nato expansion to include Ukraine was unacceptable.

At the UN Security Council, the US said shortly before Mr Putin’s announcement that an invasion was imminent.

“We are here tonight because we believe, along with Ukraine, that a full-scale, further invasion into Ukraine by Russia is imminent,” US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told an emergency meeting.

“Tonight, we’re seeing the Russians close airspace, move troops into Donbass, and move forces into combat-ready positions. This is a perilous moment.”

Often credited with predicting Superbowl outcomes among other light-hearted events, “The Simpsons” has most recently been credited on social media for anticipating something not so humorous: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Following to the tragic event, astute Twitter users analogized the conflict to a 1998 episode in the prophetic series called “Simpson Tide.” In it, Homer accidentally fires a submarine captain into Russian waters during a military exercise, prompting a newly resuscitated Soviet Union to deploy troops and tanks to the streets and instantly resurrect the Berlin Wall.

Any stalling of Russian exports would hit a wide range of industries, from fertiliser makers to food, automotive and aircraft manufacturers. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer and also accounts for 14% of the world’s aluminium output. Meanwhile, Ukraine produces a quarter of the world’s neon, which is vital to manufacturing semiconductors. Mr Koray Kose, a senior analyst in supply chain research at Gartner, shared his thoughts on which industries would be the most severely hit and the pressing issues that the logistics industry has to deal with.

Soo Sweet,UCHTj_Vvyfrospiuu1PmeOpQ,1645800940.0,Ukraine conflict: Fighting rages near Kyiv after Russia invasion,"Ukraine's army is trying to repel a full-scale Russian invasion, with fierce battles taking place close to the capital Kyiv.

Fighting is raging at an airfield on the outskirts of the city, and it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv if its troops seize it.

The Russian assault is being fought on several fronts after it attacked from the east, north and south on Thursday.

Kyiv has been hit by blasts, and at least one block of flats was damaged.

There are also reports of gunfire inside the city and on its northern outskirts, amid Ukrainian government warnings that ""saboteurs"" may already be operating inside the city.Overnight, families took shelter in Kyiv's metro stations as aerial attacks struck the city, including the densely-populated Pozniake area, injuring at least eight.

""Putin, we want to see you slaughtered like an animal,"" one Kyiv resident told the BBC's Nick Beake.

Ukrainian officials said there had been missile strikes on the city and a Russian aircraft had been shot down.

""They [the Russians] say that civilian objects are not targets. It is a lie,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video released early on Friday. ""The reality is that they don't see a difference in which areas they target.""

Ukraine says at least 137 people - civilians and soldiers - have been killed, with UN estimates suggesting more than 100,000 people have already fled from their homes. Overnight, at least 1,000 Ukrainians arrived by train in Poland's south-eastern city of Przemysl alone.

British Defence Minister Ben Wallace said the UK estimated Russia had lost 450 personnel since Moscow launched the offensive in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Channel 4 News,UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w,1645924476.0,Russia Ukraine conflict: World reaction to Putin’s invasion,"Across the world people have been rallying in support of Ukraine, including in the UK where hundreds gathered outside Downing Street for the second day running, condemning Vladimir Putin and calling for more action by the West. 

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

Meanwhile, the Government is facing calls to abandon visa restrictions for Ukranians which prevent them joining relatives in the UK. 

The Home Office said this week it had suspended issuing visas to most Ukranians, although family of UK nationals would be prioritised. 

The shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said people with family here in Britain should be able to join them ""as a top priority"" - without being held up by ""bureaucracy and delay"".

We first start by looking at how it all began and when the first Russia troops entered into the country followed by Putin's announcement for a ""Military Operation"". Then we look at the events that unfolded on the 24th, including the announcement made by President Zelensky to enact martial law within his country. Next, we look at the events that have happened around the Ukraine capital of Kyiv on the first few days, and the attempt by Russia to take over the city. Next we look at the new sanctions that have been announced by the United States, UK, and the European Union. Afterwards, we look at the activation of NATO for the first time ever. Lastly, we look briefly at the possibility of delegation between Russia and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus.

RELATED: Russia invades Ukraine, Biden calls out Putin for 'premeditated war' https://bit.ly/3pfgmYc

Tanks rolled into Ukraine unabated. Families packed into darkened subway stations to take shelter from bombs. Others filled suitcases and fled along clogged roadways out of cities.

The images emerging from Ukraine on Thursday evoke memories of 20th-century conflicts in Europe that once seemed unimaginable in 2022, leaving many to wonder: Is this a new Cold War? Or the beginning of World War III?

""In terms of cold war, you have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he's doing,"" President Joe Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin at a news conference Thursday afternoon. ""And so it's going to be a cold day for Russia.""

Natural Events,UChHv_4E1FD26pMjSByiheuQ,1645915731.0,Russian Invasion of Ukraine [Compilation of Videos],"On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, its neighbor to the southwest, marking the largest escalation of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. The campaign was preceded by a prolonged Russian military build-up beginning in early 2021. Putin, claiming that post-1997 NATO expansion is a security threat for Russia, demanded that Ukraine be legally prohibited from joining the military alliance of NATO. He also cited 'historical injustices' regarding the dissolution of the Soviet Union and claimed that Ukraine and its people are fundamentally part of Russia, ideas which have been labelled Russian irredentism. Days prior to the invasion, Russia recognized two self-proclaimed states within Ukraine's borders: the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The Russian Armed Forces entered the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine on 21 February. On 22 February, the Russian Federation Council unanimously authorized the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, to use military force outside Russia.

Around 05:00 local time (06:00 Moscow Time) on 24 February, Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine; minutes later, missile strikes began at locations across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. The Ukrainian Border Service stated that its border posts with Russia and Belarus were attacked. Two hours later, Russian ground forces entered the country. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, responded by enacting martial law, severing diplomatic ties with Russia and announcing general mobilization. The invasion received widespread international condemnation, including sanctions being imposed on Russia, while anti-war protests in Russia were met with mass arrests.

The Scottish Sun,UCGsWuDobZsVhzuotDmyxmYg,1646070880.0,Thousands marched through Edinburgh to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"Campaigners supporting Ukraine continue to be defiant in Edinburgh as thousands marched through the capital’s streets to condemn Russia’s ongoing military invasion of Ukraine.

Sounds of beating drums and bells rang out through the city as demonstrators headed from the Russian consulate to the Scottish Parliament building chanting “Putin murderer” and “hands off Ukraine” on Sunday.

Main roads, including Princes Street, were blocked as campaigners carrying placards with messages such as Free Ukraine and No War encouraged people watching from the sidelines to join them in their clear opposition to the invasion.

Since Russian troops descended on Ukraine early on Thursday, Scotland has seen a number of protests against the military action of President Vladimir Putin’s Russian regime.

Slava Yevminova, from Ukraine, attended the demonstration despite having not slept properly for three days, lying in wait for messages from friends and relatives as her home country is blighted by shelling and gunfire.

The 41-year-old, who runs her own business in Edinburgh, said her home city of Kharkiv has become “hell” since war broke out.

“Kharkiv is today hell on earth,” the 41-year-old said, fighting back tears.

“It’s not the beautiful city I remember and that I was born in.

“Some of my friends are hiding in cellars, some are trying to flee the city and some they have taken arms in their hands and they are protecting their home.”

At the time of the protest, Russian troops were drawing closer to Kyiv, a city of almost three million, street fighting broke out in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, and strategic ports in the country’s south came under pressure from the invading forces.

Jesse Dollemore,UCUSySH2YjIwsDu2Hx6DWwTA,1646186421.0,Pat Robertson Sides w/ Putin - BLAMES GOD for Russian Invasion of Ukraine!,"Jesse talks about the unhinged statement made by Pat Robertson on CBN about Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. Specifically he said, ""I think you can say, well, Putin’s out of his mind. Yes, maybe so, but at the same time, he’s being compelled by God. He went into the Ukraine, but that wasn’t his goal. His goal was to move against Israel, ultimately. God is getting ready to do something amazing, and that will be fulfilled.”

Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, tweeted: 
‘Elon musk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people!"".
Elon Musk replied in few hours ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,"" 
The tweet came about ten hours after Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov urged Musk to provide Starlink services to Ukraine, which had been invaded just days before by neighboring Russia. 
Starlink internet service is proved to be helpful at the time of war.
Elon Musk is living up to his reputation as a real-life IRON MAN

Russian missile blows up The City Council building in Kharkiv Ukraine
Kiev The beautiful city that Russia is trying to ravage
Kyiv or Kiev  is the capital and most populous city of the country of Ukraine. It is in north-central Ukraine along the Dnieper River. As of 1 January 2021 its population was 2,962,180 making Kyiv the seventh-most populous city in Europe.

Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational, and cultural center in Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kyiv Metro.

The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. During its history, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kyiv was a tributary of the Khazars, until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of Kievan Rus', the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours, first Lithuania, then Poland and ultimately Russia.

The city prospered again during the Russian Empire's Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1918, after the Ukrainian People's Republic declared independence from Soviet Russia, Kyiv became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kyiv was a city of Soviet Ukraine, which was proclaimed by the Red Army, and, from 1934, Kyiv was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during World War II but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the Soviet Union's third-largest city.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, Kyiv remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country. During the country's transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy, Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kyiv's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections.

Tech Baba,UCf1CFIE2jKfIaZhEo3PtJOw,1646159406.0,Ukraine की Tech-Industry का अंत .!! | Ukraine Tech sector after Russian Invasion | Tech Baba,"Hello
My Dear Techie's

As Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on 24th Feb 2022, it sent shockwaves around the world and threatened to undo decades of relative peace and stability in Europe. Ukraine’s fragile economy and small technology startup scene are also threatened by the turmoil.

Ukraine’s startup industry is small, though a number of notable companies and entrepreneurs hail from the former Soviet nation. 

Given its comparatively low cost of living, Ukraine has also emerged as a hub for tech companies around the world to source cheap talent. But with such worthy talents, many of the companies on 25th Feb, were seen rushing to evacuate employees or provide other assistance. Russia's invasion on Ukraine has brought the entire nation to a state of emergency.

In this video we have discussed everything about the current status of the Ukrainian Tech Industry .and the problems they are facing in this conflict.

On February 24th, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a “special military operation,” but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.

Ukraine and Russia’s conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it’s important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe’s current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe’s power balance today. 

To understand the current conflict’s history in less than 10 minutes, watch the video above.

A massive convoy of Russian military trucks is on its way to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. A missile strike was launched at central Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. 

According to reports, Kherson is encircled, and Russian troops are marching through the town. 

At the weekend, Russian airborne and special forces personnel were said to be participating in urban combat in northwestern Kyiv, although tanks and armoured vehicles have yet to arrive in the city. 

The majority of Russia's ground forces are still more than 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) from Kyiv, according to the British Ministry of Defence (MoD), with their approach halted by Ukrainian soldiers protecting Hostomel airport.

Committee for the Republic,UCBCYe_EdsCwiEQ8jV3AMplQ,1646359728.0,"Putin's Invasion of Ukraine Salon | Ray McGovern, John Mearsheimer","To a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To an empire, everything looks like a crisis to justify a multi-trillion-dollar military-industrial-security complex as dictatress of the world. The crisis du jour for the American empire is Russia‘s aggression against Ukraine. The political establishment and the mainstream media assign responsibility to President Putin’s megalomaniac ambition to recreate the Soviet empire. The Committee welcomes Ray McGovern and John Mearsheimer as a breath of fresh air. They shoulder the United States with a fair share of the blame: the never-ending expansion of NATO cheek by jowl to Russian borders provoked the invasion ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-alxZvUCS8 ); Russia fears nuclear weapons on its borders as more menacing than the Cuban Missile Crisis was to the United States. Ray and John will offer some thoughts regarding how to bury the hatchet and move forward. We all look forward to what we know will be a robust discussion.

John Mearsheimer returns for the third time as a salon speaker. We hosted John for his trenchant analysis of the abject failure our quest for global dominance and for his courageous book with Steve Walt on the liability of American support for Israel. John is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 1982. He graduated from West Point (1970), has a PhD in political science from Cornell University (1981), and has written extensively about security issues and international politics. In 2003, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2020, he won the James Madison Award, given by the American Political Science Association to “an American political scientist who has made a distinguished scholarly contribution to political science.” His principal work on Ukraine is “Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the West’s Fault: The Liberal Delusions That Provoked Putin,” appearing in September-October Foreign Affairs 2014. The video of his talk has been viewed more than 14 million times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4.

Ray McGovern is a long-time Russian specialist. After serving as an Army combat intelligence officer in the early 60s, Ray joined the CIA’s analyst ranks. His first portfolio focused on the Sino-Soviet conflict, which was deftly exploited by Nixon/Kissinger (with more than just interpreter assistance from our own Chas Freeman). As chief of the Soviet Foreign Policy Branch, Ray’s analytical team supported the SALT negotiations and he was in Moscow for the signing of the ABM Treaty, cornerstone of strategic stability for the next three decades. Ray correctly predicted Brezhnev's invasion of Czechoslovakia but incorrectly predicted Putin would not invade Ukraine. Ray thinks the new Russia-China entente helps explain Putin's gamble.

There's a less recognized but equally dangerous subtext to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
China may see an opportunity to move if the United States is distracted as it attempting to secure sensitive border regions in Eastern Europe. The Pentagon officials have routinely emphasized that U.S. forces will not fight in Ukraine, but could China gamble on the possibility that the U.S might take a similar stance regarding Taiwan?

Simple History,UC510QYlOlKNyhy_zdQxnGYw,1646427829.0,Russia's Invasion of Ukraine,"In the final years of the First World War, the Russian Empire was coming to its end. It had been devastated by revolution and finally transformed into the first Communist country in the World. In the years following the Revolution, non-Russian nations that lived under the House of Romanov sought to secure their long-lost independence. One of these was Ukrainе. From 1917 until 1921, the Ukrainians had struggled to build and secure an independent country, fighting against the new regime, against their neighbors in the west, and also among themselves.

Ayushman Pandita,UCyWN-BnWSKeHEnNOYvvpNnA,1646425287.0,The Real Reason Why USA & EU Failed To Stop Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine | Russia Ukraine War,"Russia and Ukraine are at war after Russia decided to invade Ukraine on 24th February. The west has imposed many economic sanctions on Russia to stop Russia's invasion. The EU and USA has imposed many sanctions on Russia but many expert believe that these sanctions won't be enough to stop Putin this time. Let's find out if these sanctions would be helpful in protecting Ukraine and why some experts believe that economic sanctions won't be effective on Russia this time.

Economic sanctions are commercial and financial penalties applied by one or more countries against a targeted self-governing state, group, or individual. After Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, the west imposed many sanctions on Russia which hurt the Russian economy and Ruble a lot. The inflation was as high as 15% after the sanctions and GDP slowed down to 2-3% per annually. But after 2014, Russia has taken many strategic steps to reduce its dependency on the western nations especially USA and European Union. We will discuss about all these things in this video.

Conversations That Matter,UCaOBg1kkPaM-cluL6D2DNoQ,1646424038.0,"What Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means to Canada (w/ Jeffrey Simpson, journalist)","On Thursday, February 24th, 2022, Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to invade Ukraine. Jeffrey Simpson, renowned journalist and Russian expert, says, “It was a combination of irredentism, great Russian chauvinism and authoritarian rule in play and they have forced us to recast our thinking” – forced us to reshape our perception of the post-Cold War era. 

That is an era that saw the spread of liberal democratic policies push east through Europe to the western borders of Russia. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has accepted membership from a unified Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

Then in 2005, talks began with Ukraine to join NATO. While that has not happened, many other countries that encircle the Russian western front have joined the alliance. Putin has had enough and last Thursday, he shot back by attacking Ukraine.

The attack exposed a myriad of geopolitical and international trade issues that are unraveling as the Russian army continues to advance on Kyiv. Stuart McNish invited Jeffery Simpson to join him for a Conversation that Matters about what Russia’s invasion is about and what it will mean to the world – and Canada.

Sky News,UCoMdktPbSTixAyNGwb-UYkQ,1646620211.0,Ukraine Invasion: Sky News team under heavy fire as they were ambushed by Russian forces,"The devastation and destruction rained down on Ukraine by the Russian forces has taken many civilian lives. 

President Putin insists that only military targets are being attacked but many ordinary people, often trying to flee the violence, have been killed. 

How that happens was made terrifyingly clear to one of our Sky News teams reporting from there this week. 

Russian forces were nowhere to be seen as Stuart Ramsay’s team carefully drove through a town near Kiyv on Monday afternoon. 

But, without warning, they came under heavy and sustained gunfire from what the Ukrainians believe to be a Russian reconnaissance squad. 

Incredibly Stuart, his producers, Dominique Van Heerden, Martin Vowles and Andrii Lytvynenko and his camera operator Richie Mockler escaped with their lives. 

Sky News has decided to tell the story of what happened to show the sheer scale of the mayhem and violence as the Russian invasion enters a new, and very deadly phase. The team are now safely back in the UK.

Foreign fighters have begun arriving in Ukraine to help fight the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN that around 20,000 international volunteers have come to help shore up Ukraine’s defences. The volunteers have responded to calls by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to join an “international legion” he created to bolster his nation’s defences. Many of the volunteers say they answered the call to support a “just cause” to support democracy. Their governments, however, have given a mixed response to their enlistment.

FRANCE 24 English,UCQfwfsi5VrQ8yKZ-UWmAEFg,1646783890.0,Amnesty International: Russia's invasion of Ukraine is 'a crime under international law',"Cécile Coudriou, President of Amnesty International France, joins FRANCE 24 and acknowledges that her organization has taken a ""very strong position."" Nevertheless, she asserts that they are ""absolutely justified to call [Russia's invasion of Ukraine] an aggression, according to international law."" Ms. Coudriou denounces Russia's actions, arguing that they did not have ""a legitimate defense."" She further states that Russia never sought authorization ""from the Security Council of the United Nations. So, in that case, it can be characterized as an aggression."" And now that the ICC is launching a war crimes investigation over Russia's assault on Ukraine, Ms. Coudriou is hoping that Vladimir Putin will face justice for his actions, not only in Ukraine, but also in Syria. ""Our organization is trying to document, day after day, these war crimes because it will help in the investigation conducted by the International Criminal Court.""

""Further escalation, further armaments, pouring in weapons is going to make conditions worse, principally for people of Ukraine,"" says Ali.

Julyana,UCgeTGVGy8-RDj8RpLw5Nngw,1646853725.0,Julyana - RECLAIM YOURSELF -  Ukraine after Russian invasion…,"When 20 years ago I came abroad, people often asked me: “are you Russian?” “No, I'm from Ukraine.” “Where is it?”......
During the last couple of decades it has changed. Now everybody knows Ukraine. But from the outside one may get the impression that the Ukrainian nation has been existing only for these 20-30 years.

But the fact is that Ukraine has been fighting for its identity during the last four centuries. And now the history repeats itself.
And the history of Ukraine is the struggle for returning its stolen authenticity.
Stolen was the name Rus’( Kievan Rus’), which was in fact the historical name of one of the ukrainian territories and was located in the southwest from Moscow lands and from time to time they even fought against Moscow.
Stolen was the history of Ukraine. First, in the 17-18th century, when the history of the Russian Empire was being rethought and rewritten and the Moscow got the right of the political and cultural heritage of Rus’ and all its people were declared to be its one nation. The next time, in 1934, when the communists returned to the old tried and tested tools to eradicate the role of Ukrainian territories and the Ukrainian people in the formation of the Russian state.

Today we are again being lied to by Moscow . We are being bombed and told about the liberation from Nazism (signs of which we ourselves have never observed). We are being told about our common history and roots, but we know they are not. Russia calls itself our “elder brother” and is trying to dictate something to us, but we are not ethnically brothers, but simply neighbors!!
But today Ukraine is stronger than ever. Perhaps this is the effect of accumulation and the last straw was the decision of Russia to wipe out our cities and kill our people. We firmly believe that despite all the rewriting and rebuilding of our history and all the propaganda, we will be able to show the world what is Ukraine and who are Ukrainians and will be able to RECLAIM OURSELVES and UKRAINE!

Business Tips With Yulianna,UCXcQOhs2F1JH_yiumr8rIrA,1646872289.0,"What you need to know about the Ukraine-Russia conflict | Russia's invasion, explained","In this video, I explained everything that is currently happening in Ukraine. I shared some photos of Ukrainian cities before the war and how do they look now. These are terrible and unexplainable things happening in Ukraine now. 

I am originally Ukrainian, who didn't sleep properly since the invasion happened. My whole family is still in Ukraine and I am so worried about them. 

This is an unusual video on my channel and a bit out of topic, but the situation is unusual too. I think it is very important to let people know what is really happening in Ukraine right now.
