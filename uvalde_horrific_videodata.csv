The 18-year-old gunman who slaughtered 19 children and two teachers at a Texas elementary school barricaded himself inside a single classroom and “began shooting anyone that was in his way,” authorities said Wednesday in detailing the latest mass killing to rock the U.S.

Law enforcement officers eventually broke into the classroom and killed the gunman. Police and others responding to Tuesday’s attack also went around breaking windows at the school to enable students and teachers to escape, Lt. Christopher Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety said Wednesday on NBC’s “Today.”

Olivarez told CNN that all the victims were in the same fourth-grade classroom at Robb Elementary.

The killer ""barricaded himself by locking the door and just started shooting children and teachers that were inside that classroom,” he said. ""It just shows you the complete evil of the shooter.”

A gunman killed 19 children at a Texas elementary school Tuesday in the deadliest shooting at a U.S. grade school since the 2012 attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Wearing body armor and firing hundreds of rounds, the 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two adults, Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Chris Olivarez said.  Gov. Greg Abbott said one of the two was a teacher. A U.S. Border Protection agent, one of several responding to the scene, shot and killed the gunman, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told USA TODAY on Tuesday night.

In the wake of the horrific Buffalo shooting, the left-wing media tried to paint all conservatives as subscribers to “replacement theory” — the idea that immigrants are taking over to such an extent that they will destroy white Western civilization. Of course, no serious conservative believes in this ugly, racist, dangerous ideology, but there is a ton of ACTUAL replacement going on, and it has nothing to do with immigration or racism. What we saw yesterday in Uvalde, Texas, is more dark horrific evidence of the only replacement theory that ultimately matters because it affects everything. We’ve replaced God in society. Glenn argues it’s why gun control is ultimately useless — even though he completely understands our human impulse to DO something. While our culture has replaced God for rot, the Biden White House and Democrats are also working overtime to replace key elements of American political, legal, economic, and cultural life. BlazeTV host Mark Levin of “LevinTV” tells Glenn why Media Matters' latest hit job on him over his Uvalde coverage is pathetic. “Stop pushing God out of the public square” is not a radical concept to help prevent evil from taking hold in our schools. He also takes on the Democrats’ attempts to destroy the Supreme Court, voting rights, and the separation of powers. BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey of “Relatable” tells Glenn why she believes the Uvalde shooting reveals how we are failing young men in this country and what we must do to stop the replacement theory that threatens to keep an entire generation from becoming a benefit to society.

(Yes, right now it's just me making everything)

Editor's Note: My edits were all made to keep the video on one, central topic by editing together relevant commentary from many parts of Hasan's streams to create a storyline that is still followable by the viewer. I also edited in commentary of my own in places, in addition to relevant external information that improves the viewing experience. A lot of edits were made for comedy purposes, or to enhance the comedic timing of certain beats, but never to misrepresent Hasan's point of view.

Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke interrupted the state governor’s press conference on Wednesday, May 25, one day after a mass shooting left 21 people dead in Uvalde, Texas.
Video taken by Carlos Eduardo Espina shows O’Rourke approaching the stage where Texas Gov Greg Abbott was holding a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.
“Governor, I have to say something,” O’Rourke can be heard saying in the footage. “The time you needed to have stopped this was after Santa Fe High School.”
Abbott and others onstage engaged verbally with O’Rourke, telling him to “sit down” and “leave,” with one calling him a “sick son of a b***h.”
“You’re doing nothing. You’re all doing nothing … this is totally predictable when you choose not to do anything,” O’Rourke said.
“This is on you until you choose to do something different. This will continue to happen,” O’Rourke said as he was ushered away from the stage. “Somebody needs to stand up for the children of the state, or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.”
The press conference was streamed live to the governor’s Facebook page for only 35 seconds before the stream ended.
O’Rourke, a Democrat, is running against Abbott, a Republican, in Texas’s gubernatorial election in November.
Nineteen students and two adults were killed on May 24 after an 18-year-old local resident pushed past officers and barricaded himself inside a fourth grade classroom at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, according to officials’ latest updates.

""There was blood in the hallway and children were covered in it, one of the students who survived the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, told ABC News.

""[The shooter] came in and said, 'You're all gonna die,' and just started shooting,"" Samuel Salinas, 10, recalled in an interview airing Friday on ""Good Morning America.""

Salinas was a student in Irma Garcia's fourth-grade class. They were scheduled to graduate Thursday, but the ceremony was canceled because Garcia, another teacher and 19 third- and fourth-grade students were killed in Tuesday's massacre. Another 17 people were wounded, including three law enforcement officers.

The gunman, Salvador Ramos, allegedly purchased two assault rifles just days after turning 18 and used them to carry out the second-worst school shooting in U.S. history, killing 21 people, according to authorities.

Some of the children and teachers who walked into school that day had no idea it would be their last.""

The Michigan high school experienced a mass shooting last November where four students were killed by a sophomore at the school.
This footage, captured by Oxford student Jadon Ebeling, shows scenes at the school on Thursday afternoon as helicopters flew overhead.

Storyful Viral,UC5ovaFtNA0Jbq7mf0vdKYjg,1653731943.0,Texas Governor Abbott Says He Was 'Misled' About Uvalde Shooting,"Texas Governor Abbott Says He Was 'Misled' About Uvalde Shooting
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on May 27 that he was initially “misled” in the aftermath of the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, as authorities in the state came under intense criticism for failing to act sooner to stop the attack.
“I was misled,” said Abbott, referring to remarks he made following the May 24 shooting, which he said were based on briefings he’d been just been given. “As everybody has learned, the information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate, and I am absolutely livid about that.”
After days of uncertainty around the law enforcement response in Uvalde, authorities on Friday revealed that students made a series of 911 calls over more than an hour as they awaited rescue. Up to 19 officers were in a hallway outside a classroom where the shooter, Salvador Ramos, had holed up, but made no effort to incapacitate him.
Abbott had earlier praised the response of law enforcement officers, saying on Wednesday that “it could have been worse… The reason it was not worse is because law enforcement officials did what they do.”
After the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, law enforcement moved towards response plans that aimed to incapacitate any shooter as soon as possible, and not wait for backup. In Uvalde, officials now admit officers on the scene did not follow that strategy.

I am in no way insinuating that all LEO are cowards. I know many pipe hitters and good hearted men serving our communities, but what we are facing is violent and evil. 

What we cannot tolerate is brokenness within the ranks that are suppose to be our protectors as citizens of the United States. 

It’s getting to the point so many cannot be trusted to fulfill their oath and obligation they took as our protectors and this video is designed to bring some truth to light on the subject. 

We have officers self glorifying all over the internet instead of doing their jobs. We have officers incapable of performing their duties with a firearm in a defensive situation. We have officers that refuse to enter active shooter situations to save innocent lives. We have officers that have no desire to train to better themselves.  

If this sounds like you then I’m talking to you. I have no pity for you. If you are a ball busting LEO putting in the work I have nothing but respect for you. 

What we can’t do is ignore this anymore.

Senate Republicans recently voted down a bill intended to combat what Democrats say is a rise in domestic terrorism, noting the bill constituted the creation of “thought police” offices within federal agencies. On a deeper level, however, the arguments for the bill were based on a false pretense that a recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, was done by a “far-right extremist.” In reality, the shooter appeared to be a far-left National Bolshevist, as have others. We invite Trevor Loudon, host of Counterpunch and author of “Enemies Within,” to explain this.

In other news, another mass shooting recently took place in Uvalde, Texas, where a man shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school. The tragedy is being used politically by Democrats to advance an agenda against firearms, yet emerging information has undermined a central argument to the gun control narrative—that firearms are not needed for defense, when police provide this as a service—since police waited nearly an hour to stop the shooter, out of fear for their own safety.

In this live Q&A with Crossroads host Joshua Philipp, we’ll discuss these stories and others, and answer questions from the audience.

Satan feeds the imagination to get you emotional: ""What if it were your kids?"" People talk about the attacks on the Second Amendment as well as trauma from ""bullying"" and ""abuse."" Jesse then asks: Are you living in a natural or unnatural state? Know yourself by knowing the not-you. Be in the world, but not of it, not moved by others. Don't identify with your children.

She had a message for President Biden and the Media which she shared with us.

""We need to stop putting each other down"" 

Nicole was in the school and she saw the shooter who she doesn't want to adress by his name ""he does not deserve it and he is the only one I blame"".

She got upset when someone said Uvalde police are pussies ""They saved me, they were in the building when shooter shot at my door"".

She went into details about what she saw inside the school, police response and about what their community needs from people.

Her daughter Trinity who is in high school explained that their community is very small and people need to understand that, they need unity.

PRC Podcast,UC96irjgH_0WT42AMxtCHISQ,1653904650.0,PLEASE REMAIN CALM PODCAST EPISODE 82: THE UVALDE SHOOTING,"We talk about the horrific elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Not just the details of the event, but what its like to respond to shootings with kids, shootings with multiple victims, active shooter situations, & the PTSD for the first responders that work these scenes. We talk about what its like to work in the neighborhood you grew up in, or still live in. The risk of having to treat your immediate family members. The fear of possibly making a mistake with someone you know personally on a 911 call. What if you have to triage a mass shooting, telling parents theres nothing you can do, & moving on to try to save more kids. What about finding out your own child died at the incident you're working at? We also get into the challenges leading up to this event, the respose, timeline, everything including how we feel as parents.

International Personal Development Association,UCFesk1tAKx_bF9OBgLpXUHQ,1653870317.0,"Gun Control, National Rifle Association and Uvalde Shooting","19 children and 2 teachers are being buried in Uvalde, Texas this weekend; the innocent victims of another mass shooting. The National Rifle Association decided to hold their convention anyway, creating outrage and protests. Some of the entertainers cancelled out of respect for the families, others, like President Trump, spoke at the meeting. Was it right for the NRA to hold a gun convention following a mass murder of 19 children? Are they right, or evil? Do they really care about how these parents feel? Or should they have gone about business as usual? (which is what they did) Gun control is back in the news, and we've all heard the pundits weigh-in this week. I want to know what YOU think. I was one of the first people to go on MSNBC after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 and debate gun control with David Corn (Mother Jones Magazine) and Michael Smerconish. (former MSNBC/current CNN host) After the show I recieved multiple death threats. Now, 10 years later, the problem is even worse. Watch this short (4-minute) video and please weigh-in on what you think is the answer. The politicians aren't mature enough to engage in robust, respectful debate, but we certainly can. Its the only way we're going to solve these serious issues.",25,113,7,3,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t8vNFWC_02w/hqdefault.jpg,steve siebold|mental toughness|Critical Thinking|National Rifle Association|Uvalde Texas Shooting|Gun Control,2023-11-28 17:49:42.313073,6,2022-05-29,2022-05-30 00:25:17

With so much going on this week, it felt like the appropriate time to do another Q&A episode.

Contributing Writer Jake Fogelman joined me to answer some of the most pressing questions from Reload Members. With the NRA Annual Meeting taking place in Houston, Texas just a few days after a horrific school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, there is a lot to discuss.

Members wanted to know how gun owners can best respond to attacks like this. What are some policy solutions? What's the best way to avoid bad-faith fights without completely ceding the conversation to the loudest voices? Could the Uvalde or Buffalo attacks have been prevented under our current laws?

There were also several questions about the state of the NRA and the gun-rights movement at large. How bad have things gotten at the NRA? Are other gun-rights groups able to fill whatever gaps the NRA's struggles have created? What lies ahead?

We answer those questions and more.",25,184,3,13,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bLVhHzDTLUI/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-11-28 17:49:42.313073,7,2022-05-30,2022-05-30 15:00:29
Gregory Wong,UCbHCssfP5m9LSp-ozmcZXvg,1653937310.0,"UVALDE SHOOTING  As a grandfather, I send my condolences to all victims  & offer this as my prayer…","Dear friends,
﻿
﻿Listening to the news when returning home from church this Sunday, the death of the 21 people, mostly kids, put me into deep sorrow.   Being an Asian coming from Hong Kong, I always feel sad when hearing people got killed by gunshots.  This time is particularly shocking as 19 of them were young kids, in their golden age.  Looking at the heartbreaking parents in TV, I can totally understand their pain and anger, being a grandfather of 4 grandchildren from 7 to 12.  Just thinking if this happens to them will make me shiver and drive me crazy.  I know I can do nothing to help, not even a hug to each of their family members to show my concern and send my condolences.  But I remember I just played a piece in church, the Consolation #3, and nothing is more meaningful than this as my prayer to show my deepest sympathy and sorrow.  Let’s pray and may God show mercy to them all and let the kids and their teacher, follow the last note, rest in eternal peace.
P.S. The piece is not playing too well in normal standard and hope you all don’t mind.  I am praying with my heart even though I have never learnt piano.",22,176,2,4,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nLTeNeTnA8/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-11-28 17:49:42.313073,7,2022-05-30,2022-05-30 19:01:50

On Saturday, journalist Lauren Windsor tweeted about being able to sneak inside the venue where Trump was holding his speech by simply walking in through an unlocked door past an officer at the entrance.""

Bloomberg Quicktake,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1654050715.0,Memorial for Uvalde Shooting Victims Grows,"It should have been the first day of a joyous week for Robb Elementary School students — the start of summer break. Instead, the first two of 19 children slain inside a classroom were being remembered at funeral visitations.

The gathering for 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza was at Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home on Monday in Uvalde, Texas, directly across from the grade school where the children, along with two teachers, were shot to death last week before the gunman himself was killed. Visitation for another 10-year-old, Maite Rodriguez, was at the town's other funeral home.

Over the next two-and-a-half traumatic weeks, people in the southwestern Texas town will say goodbye to the children and their teachers, one heart-wrenching visitation, funeral and burial after another.

As family and friends unleash their grief, investigators will push for answers about how police responded to the May 24 shooting, and lawmakers have said they'll consider what can be done to stem the gun violence permeating the nation.

This week alone, funerals are planned for 11 children and teacher Irma Garcia.

CBS Austin,UCT2FAPpgWOGGXtpheDT6jkQ,1654047023.0,Uvalde shooting sparks conversations about Texas gun laws,"The recent tragedy in Uvalde has sparked conversations about if there should be changes to gun laws in Texas.

After last week’s devastating shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers, people are asking what is being done to prevent that situation from happening again? Depending on who you ask, some say gun control reform is needed.

“Texas has some of the weakest gun laws in the country,” said Nicole Golden with Texas Gun Sense.

Texas gun sense is a nonprofit that advocates for sensible gun laws. Golden says lawmakers should focus on gun control legislation that will increase public safety.

WFAA,UCBu0KdNokE4MqdkacvH37_A,1654589586.0,'She is a miracle': Family of Uvalde shooting survivor recounts the terror,"'She is a miracle': Family of Uvalde survivor recounts elementary school shooting terror

In the midst of so much tragedy, there is a miracle at University Health Hospital in San Antonio. “Yes, she is a miracle,” said the grandparents of 9-year-old Kendall Olivarez. “All my grandkids, I don’t like for them to be suffering,” said Jimmy Olivarez.

This brave girl is everything that’s inspiring. Kendall, who loves dancing, Mexican bingo and TikTok videos, remembers the moment the gunman stormed into her classroom. 

“That’s gonna stay with her forever, how she saw her teacher get shot. It just happened right in front of her,” said Tina.

Shot twice, once in the left shoulder and in her back, Kendall is alive and able to tell her parents what happened inside Robb Elementary.

TransLash,UCBCVSqLYR6OQM03xrn5wQXg,1654560928.0,The Uvalde Shooting Leads to Online Trans Hate: Sydney Bauer,"➡️  In the most recent episode of TransLash Podcast with Imara Jones, ‘The Uvalde Shooting Leads to Online Trans Hate', Imara interviews Sydney Bauer, Journalist. ⭐ Here’s a sneak peek into the episode. 🎧  Listen to ‘The Uvalde Shooting Leads to Online Trans Hate' full episode: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jLUE5zGerANXAIGbVD3ps?si=9331fa5440264c9c

“I think I was just afraid that other trans people were going to be harassed because of this. And that ended up happening, which is terrifying. People who don't have the media literacy of understanding what is a trolling campaign are going to read this, and they're going to say that we're evil and they're going to demonize our community far beyond this one photo that was being shared. And I'm just afraid of people, especially in Texas right now, because the government is coming after trans kids.” 

📸  Image Description: An orange, blue, and white blocked background holds an image of Sydney in the center, along with her title, and the above quoted text.

With anti-trans violence and political backlash at all-time highs, award-winning journalist Imara Jones hosts this podcast where trans people and allies talk back about what matters most and discuss how to create a fairer world for all.
